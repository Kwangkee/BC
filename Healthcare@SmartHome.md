## The Smart Home: Can It Replace Traditional Health Care?   
The Smart Home: Can It Replace Traditional Health Care?, https://www.verywellhealth.com/smart-home-and-healthcare-in-the-future-4157938   

However, individual smart health gadgets such as smartwatches and activity trackers are not currently suitable to monitor our health holistically. New solutions are required, and many are currently being innovated. Experts agree that these solutions should be based on interoperability where devices can communicate with each other.

#### Chronic Disease Management at Home
The current healthcare model that relies on home visits by nurses, doctors, and therapists is gradually being replaced by new services. [Trapollo](https://www.trapollo.com/), a company that Cox Communications has acquired, has been developing different solutions for remote health care.

Researchers from the well-known Scripps Translational Science Institute in La Jolla, California, report on a 2017 study that showed that telemonitoring of oxygen saturation, blood pressure, body temperature, and respiratory biometrics can significantly reduce re-admissions of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). On the other hand, telemonitoring of frail people with multiple conditions might be more challenging and will likely require proper supporting systems and protocols. So far, technology aimed at specific chronic conditions received better feedback and has more scientific support.5

For instance, home technology has proven useful in the care of people with dementia. For dementia, it is being used for reminders and helps guide those dealing with dementia in the common activities of daily living. Computerized devices, such as COACH, can autonomously guide an older person with dementia through activities (e.g. hand washing) using audio and/or audio-video prompts, thus reducing the need for assistance. COACH can determine the state of the task and decide if a person needs a reminder and, if so, which one.6

#### Can Smart Home Devices Replace Healthcare Services?
Connected smart homes might not yet be able to completely replace existing healthcare services, but they can add value to the healthcare continuum of care, improve the quality of care, and reduce the mounting pressures on a healthcare system that in many ways is overcapacity.

But, again, smartwatches are not the only devices consumers are interested in acquiring for personal or household use. Intentions to purchase connected weight scales, blood pressure cuffs, and thermometers have doubled year-over-year. Consumers want better insight into their health, a better ability to care for their family, and they are looking for solutions to help them do so at home.
