## European Society of Hypertension
- ARE COMMERCIAL CUFFLESS BLOOD PRESSURE DEVICES BEING VALIDATED?, https://journals.lww.com/jhypertension/Abstract/2022/06001/ARE_COMMERCIAL_CUFFLESS_BLOOD_PRESSURE_DEVICES.248.aspx
  >Conclusions: Current cuffless BP devices lack published validity and as a result clinical utility. Performing stringent testing on the accuracy and reliability of devices will result in the progression and acceptance of such devices with the capacity to revolutionise BP measurement and therefore hypertension.
- Cuffless blood pressure measuring devices: review and statement by the European Society of Hypertension Working Group on Blood Pressure Monitoring and Cardiovascular Variability, https://journals.lww.com/jhypertension/Fulltext/2022/08000/Cuffless_blood_pressure_measuring_devices__review.2.aspx
  >Conclusion: Cuffless BP devices have considerable potential for changing the diagnosis and management of hypertension. However, fundamental questions regarding their accuracy, performance, and implementation need to be carefully addressed before they can be recommended for clinical use.
- Cuffless blood pressure devices: the gap between patient acceptability and need for validation, https://journals.lww.com/jhypertension/Citation/2022/11000/Cuffless_blood_pressure_devices__the_gap_between.26.aspx
  >Conclusion: However, cuffless BP device accuracy is yet to be determined, with appropriate cuffless device validation protocols still under development. Given the high proportion of people with undiagnosed hypertension in the community, there is need to balance high participant acceptability and need for increased BP awareness in the community with fundamental concerns about accuracy [1].
