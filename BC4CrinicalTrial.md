- Future Work
>Our future work will continue to investigate the needs of the clinical trial process and add more comprehensive functions to the proposed blockchain-based CTMS architecture, such as **adding machine learning tools to monitor patient conditions persistently and predict side effects and overall outcomes**. 
>- The current safety monitoring process described in the Study Conduct section relies on the EDC process. However, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board convenes only when the clinical trial has been conducted for a while and the data have met a certain point. **Adding artificial intelligence components to the Study Conduct module can achieve more efficient monitoring.** 
>- We will also investigate more potential in CTMS design using blockchain technology, such as integrating secure multiparty computation with blockchain for computational applications such as subject matching and using the cryptocurrency concept to build a novel CTMS that will help ensure timely validation and payment.

## Using Blockchain Technology to Manage Clinical Trials Data: A Proof-of-Concept Study  
https://medinform.jmir.org/2018/4/e11949/  

Results:  
>We described **BlockTrial, a system that uses a Web-based interface to allow users to run trials-related Smart Contracts on an Ethereum network**. Functions allow patients to grant researchers access to their data and allow researchers to submit queries for data that are stored off chain. As a type of distributed ledger, the system generates a durable and transparent log of these and other transactions. BlockTrial could be used to increase the trustworthiness of data collected during clinical research with benefits to researchers, regulators, and drug companies alike. In addition, the system could empower patients to become more active and fully informed partners in research.

Conclusions:  
>Blockchain technology presents an opportunity to address some of the common threats to the integrity of data collected in clinical trials and ensure that the analysis of these data comply with prespecified plans. Further technical work is needed to add additional functions. Policies must be developed to determine the optimal models for participation in the system by its various stakeholders.
